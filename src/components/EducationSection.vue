                <p>
                  I am currently enrolled as a student at Life Choices Academy to become a full stack developer and I am learning a lot. The environment encourages growth and development not only when it comes to learning how to code but also personal development.

                <p>
                  I obtained my Bachelor of Science degree in Biotechnology and while the journey had its challenges and obstacles, It has taught me a lot about how failure is needed for growth and it takes perseverance and dedication to succeed. It was quite rigorous and at times I definitely had moments of doubt and uncertainty. However, the challenges I faced have shaped me into the resilient and determined individual I am today.

                <h4>Internship</h4>
                <p>
                  I had the opportunity to participate in a science internship that provided me with invaluable experiences and insights into the world of scientific research. Throughout the internship, I was immersed in a dynamic and collaborative environment where I worked alongside seasoned scientists and researchers.

                <h4>High School</h4>
                <p>
                  I went to Grassdale High School and while it was a major adjustment, each obstacle served as an opportunity for growth and self-discovery. High school provided me with a solid foundation upon which to build my future aspirations and pursue my dreams. As I reflect on my high school experience, I am grateful for the memories, lessons, and friendships which I have obtained along the way.
